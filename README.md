# practicing-expressJS

This repository contains a basic project I built while learning **Express.js**.

I practiced:

- Setting up servers
- Creating RESTful APIs with CRUD operations
- Using middleware
- Handling JSON data
- Rendering dynamic HTML with **Express Handlebars**.

It helped me understand how to build backend applications from scratch and manage routes, data, and templates efficiently.
